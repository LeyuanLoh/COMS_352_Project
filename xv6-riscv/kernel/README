Progress: 
As from our testing, we think that we have complemented all of the features corretly, including the priority boost. 
For the priority queue, we have used the second method (qtable) described in the project description. 
We have placed priority boost, and preempting featureus in yield() in proc.c. For the priority boost, we have a global ticks counter
- global_ticks. In yield(), we check if global_ticks % 32 == 0, then we do priority boost. 

Result:

After running

$ schedtest 4 10000000 &
$   
$ schedtest 0 40000000 &

we get

pid     ticks   queue
1       0       0         //init
2       0       0         //init
9       0       0         //pstat
4       0       0         //first schedtest
6       1       1         //second schedtest
8       24      2         //third schedtest

pid 3 = sh
pid 5 = sh
pid 6 = sh

Please note that sometimes the second schedtest is in queue 0.
